## Strategies for rapidly pivoting to remote work [panel]

### How has it affected the panelist's work lives?
- Stress that it is **not** a normal situation
- Even teams who were fully remote workers before COVID-19 have had to change their routines
- We're not *working from home* we're *staying at home, trying to get work done*
- We're worrying about a lot of things right now - children, parents, possible illness, uncertainty in the future. I repeat - it's not a normal situattion.

### What are some tips for everyone who is now remote working?
- Be very open with your team - when you are your screen, when you have childcare commitments, when you're struggling, what you're doing, what your current situation is
- Try to think about good posture, eating habits, staying hydrated, having a routine
- Don't expect to get as much done as you would have pre-pandemic, if you manage to get things done it's an acheivement
- Try to set goals which allow flexibility but also help ensure people don't stay blocked. E.g. try to check emails by 10am, try to review a PR by 1pm, check in at least once a day on a casual channel
- Don't forget about those trips to the tea station, how can you recreate them?

### What can be heplful for managers/leads to be focusing on right now
- Allow people to stop worrying about job security. If financials are good communicate that - it can help workers feel more relaxed while their friends/loved ones are losing their jobs
- Keep in mind it can be easy to wonder whether the project you're working on matters with all the more important things happening in the world right now
