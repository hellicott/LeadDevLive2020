## Panel: Strategies for rapidly pivoting to remote work 

### TL;DR
- focus on humans and connections over processes
- do things in small steps, make changes but preferably dont change everything at once
- get guidance from others
- keep in mind the *pandemic tax*

### How has it affected the panelist's work lives?
- Stress that it is **not** a normal situation
- Even teams who were fully remote workers before COVID-19 have had to change their routines
- We're not *working from home* we're *staying at home, trying to get work done*
- We're worrying about a lot of things right now - children, parents, possible illness, uncertainty in the future. I repeat - it's not a normal situattion.

### What are some tips for everyone who is now remote working?
- Be very open with your team - when you are your screen, when you have childcare commitments, when you're struggling, what you're doing, what your current situation is
- Try to think about good posture, eating habits, staying hydrated, having a routine
- Don't expect to get as much done as you would have pre-pandemic, if you manage to get things done it's an acheivement
- Try to set goals which allow flexibility but also help ensure people don't stay blocked. E.g. try to check emails by 10am, try to review a PR by 1pm, check in at least once a day on a casual channel
- Don't forget about those trips to the tea station, how can you recreate them? What about all those lunchtime conversations?

### What can be heplful for managers/leads to be focusing on right now
- Allow people to stop worrying about job security. If financials are good communicate that - it can help workers feel more relaxed while their friends/loved ones are losing their jobs
- Keep in mind it can be easy to wonder whether the project you're working on matters with all the more important things happening in the world right now
- Try to keep all the meetings you would normally have face to face, to ensure you can continue to work synchronously
- If 4 day weeks are a possibility, strive for them. It can allow the team to organise their time much more easily with everything new going on at the moment
- One thing that is a good consideration in general is *if you can reverse it, do it* this allows decisions to be made quickly without detrimental consequences
- Lead by example - signing off in the evening and not being back on late at night, being honest if you are struggling or have a toddler running around. This makes it acceptable for your team to do the same.
- Keep communication a priority, even with bad news - employers would rather hear bad news from you than from a tweet or a news story.

### Tips for having newly become a manger in this crazy time
- Be vulnerable - ask questions, don't act like you know (cause they know you don't know), listen to the team
- Remember it takes time to become a great manager, take it a step at a time.
- Focus on building connections and relationships, this makes a good foundation
- The step from senior engineer to junior manager can be a tricky one

### How can you manage expectations to those higher up
- Try to make processes observable to all. Someone heading up mutliple teams might benefit from all the teams starting their sprints on the same day, or staggering stand ups so they can attend them all.
- Have a clear communication channel for decision making so everyone can stay informed
- Have a guage of how people feel they are being affected by the situation. E.g. are you only working at 80% productivity this week? Can this be distributed through to sprint planning.

### How might the sudden shift to remote working affect future working 
- It could give remote working a bad rep. But it's important to remember that the situation of not being able to be outside, having kids at home, etc. majorly effects the view of the experience.
- It shows that not necessarily everyone *should* work from home, but everybody *could*. This could open up job oppurtunities to those with diabilities or unable to travel everyday and allow companies to be more open to remote working as a possibility
